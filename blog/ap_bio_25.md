# What‚Äôs New in the 2025 AP Biology Exam? A Comprehensive Guide to the Updated Curriculum

The College Board has officially rolled out a major update to the **AP Biology curriculum**, the first significant revision since 2020. Set to take full effect for the **2026 exam administration**, these changes reflect a clear shift in emphasis: **from rote memorization to scientific reasoning, data analysis, and interdisciplinary application**.

For students aiming for that coveted 5, especially those targeting competitive STEM, pre-med, or biomedical engineering pathways, understanding these updates is essential. With a historically low 5-rate of just **7%**, AP Biology remains one of the most challenging AP science exams. But with the right strategy, it can also be one of the most rewarding.

Let‚Äôs break down what‚Äôs changed, unit by unit, and what it means for your preparation.


## Big-Picture Shifts in the 2025‚Äì2026 AP Biology Exam

Before diving into the units, note these overarching trends:

- **Greater emphasis on data interpretation**: Expect more questions that require you to analyze graphs, tables, and experimental results‚Äîoften spanning multiple units.
- **Increased focus on scientific practices**: You‚Äôll need to **explain, predict, and justify**‚Äînot just recall facts.
- **Explicit graphing requirements**: The new course framework now **explicitly requires students to draw labeled, scaled graphs with proper units** in FRQs.
- **Calculator policy clarified**:  
  - ‚úÖ **Allowed (and encouraged)** in the **Free-Response section**  
  - ‚ùå **Not permitted** in the **Multiple-Choice section**. This signals a rise in **quantitative reasoning** in FRQs (e.g., Hardy-Weinberg calculations, enzyme kinetics modeling).

## What the Sample Questions Reveal

The **2025 sample exam** confirms the trend:

- **Data interpretation dominates**: A single graph might integrate ecology, evolution, and genetics.
- **Interdisciplinary thinking is non-negotiable**: You can no longer study units in isolation.
- **Graphing is now a core skill**: Be ready to **draw, label, and interpret** plots with precision.

## Strategic AP Biology Prep Plan for 2026

### **Phase 1: Foundation Building (3‚Äì4 Months Before Exam)**
- **Core text**: Master *Campbell Biology*‚Äîfocus on **conceptual understanding**, not just facts.  
- **Map connections**: Create **cross-unit concept maps** (e.g., link enzyme function in Unit 3 to metabolic diseases in Unit 6).

### **Phase 2: Skill Sharpening (2 Months Before Exam)**
- **Timed MCQ practice**: Aim for **‚â§1 minute per question**; categorize errors (concept vs. calculation).  
- **FRQ frameworks**: Use a standard structure:  
  `Claim ‚Üí Evidence ‚Üí Reasoning ‚Üí Real-world implication`

### **Phase 3: Final Simulation (1 Month Before Exam)**
- **Full-length mocks**: Use official College Board exams under real timing (90 min MCQ + 90 min FRQ).  
- **Join StudyToday, unlock premium mock questions designed by experienced tutors**
