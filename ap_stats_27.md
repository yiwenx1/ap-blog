# What’s Changing (and What’s Not) in AP Statistics for 2026-2027

If you’ve heard rumors that **AP Statistics is undergoing major changes in 2026**, you’re not alone. Many students and parents have been asking: *“Should I be worried about the 2026 AP Stats exam?”*

**Good news: You don’t need to panic.**

✅ **The May 2026 AP Statistics exam will be exactly the same as previous years, in both content and format.**  

The College Board has confirmed that **any revisions to the AP Statistics course and exam will not take effect until the 2026–2027 school year at the earliest**, meaning the first impacted exam will be in **May 2027**, not 2026.

## Why Is AP Statistics Being Updated?

The College Board periodically reviews AP courses to ensure they align with **introductory college-level statistics courses** and reflect current best practices in statistics education. The upcoming revisions aim to:

- Better align with recommendations from the **American Statistical Association (ASA)**  
- Emphasize the **full statistical problem-solving process**:  
  1. **Asking questions**  
  2. **Collecting data**  
  3. **Analyzing data**  
  4. **Interpreting results**  
- Make the course more accessible and relevant to real-world applications

In short: **The goal is to make AP Stats more practical, coherent, and student-friendly, not harder.**

## What’s Changing? (Starting in 2026–2027 School Year)

### 📚 Course Content Updates

The revised framework will **streamline and refocus** the curriculum:

#### Removed Topics
The following topics will **no longer be part of the AP Statistics curriculum**:
- Analyzing departures from linearity (formerly Section 2.9)  
- Combining random variables (Section 4.9)  
- Geometric distribution (Section 4.12)  
- Chi-square goodness-of-fit test (Sections 8.2–8.3)  
- **Entire Unit 9**: Inference for Quantitative Data: Slopes

> 💡 *Note: These topics have historically been among the least emphasized on the exam. Their removal simplifies the course without sacrificing core statistical reasoning.*

#### New Emphasis
- Greater focus on **investigative and research-oriented questions**  
- Earlier access: **The Algebra II prerequisite is being dropped**, allowing students with strong quantitative reasoning skills (even before 10th grade) to enroll

#### Restructured Units
The current 9 units will be **consolidated into 5 thematic units**, better aligned with the four statistical practices listed above.

### 📝 Exam Format Changes (Starting May 2027)

| Section | Current Format (through May 2026) | New Format (starting May 2027) |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Multiple-Choice (MCQ)** | 40 questions, 5 answer choices each | **42 questions**, **4 answer choices each** |
| | | Includes **two 3-question sets** focused on: <br> • Probability & Random Variables <br> • Regression Analysis |
| **Free-Response (FRQ)** | 6 questions (mostly 4 pts each) | **4 questions**, **10 points each** |
| | | Each FRQ integrates the **four statistical practices**: <br> • Q1: Practices 1 & 2 (Asking questions + Collecting data) <br> • Q2: Practices 3 & 4 (Analyzing + Interpreting) <br> • Q3: Inference across Practices 2–4 <br> • Q4: Synthesis across multiple content areas |

> 🔍 **Key takeaway**: Fewer FRQs, but each is more comprehensive and mirrors real statistical investigations.
